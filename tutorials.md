To get started learning AtomVM we recommend you start with the [Programmers Guide](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/main/programmers-guide.html) to familiarize yourself with the overall capabilities and limitations of the AtomVM implementation of the BEAM. There are sections covering many of the common OTP and AtomVM APIs, as well as sections for platform specific APIs.

For guidance writing applications that use networking you should start with the [Network Programming Guide](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/main/network-programming-guide.html). This guide covers the basics of network configuration.

For examples demonstrating the topics covered in both guides, and more, clone a local copy of the [atomvm_examples repository](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples). There are examples coving a range of topics, including simple examples of several network protocols for both client and server. To be comfortable building and deploying the examples in this repository you may first need to familiarize yourself with the [AtomVM tooling](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/main/atomvm-tooling.html).

Ricardo Lanziano's article ["Smart Sensors with Erlang and AtomVM: Smart cities, smart houses and manufacturing monitoring"](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/smart-sensors-with-erlang-and-atomvm-smart-cities-smart-houses-and-manufacturing-monitoring/) from [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/) is an excellent tutorial for building and deploying an application that uses additional drivers that are not included as core components of AtomVM.
